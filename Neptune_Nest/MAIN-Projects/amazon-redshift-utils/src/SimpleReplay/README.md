# Simple Replay README

## Introduction

Customers are always trying to reproduce issues or workloads from clusters or to do what-if scenarios. A customer can easily clone a production cluster, but replicating the workload is more complicated. Simple Replay was created to bridge that gap. Simple Replay V2 enhances existing Simple Replay tool by providing following additional functionalities: 

* Ability to mimic COPY and UNLOAD workloads. 
* Ability to execute the transactions and queries in the same time interval as executed in the source cluster. 

This enables the replay to be as close to the source run. It is **strongly recommended** to run Simple Replay from a cloud EC2 instance. 

## Preparation

### Step 1 - Amazon Redshift production cluster setup

The first step is to enable audit logging in the Redshift production cluster. We’ll need all 3 types of logs: connection logs, user logs and user activity logs.

1. Using AWS Console, enable audit logging in the cluster specifying an S3 bucket location to save the log files  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/db-auditing.html
2. Change the parameter group `enable_user_activity_logging` to “true”.
3. Reboot the cluster
4. Take a snapshot of the source cluster prior to execution of the workload to be captured. This snapshot will be used to restore the target cluster, ensuring the target cluster is in the same state as the source cluster.

It may take around three hours for the audit logs to be delivered to S3.

### Step 2 - Simple Replay setup

1. Create an EC2 instance
    1. Recommended EC2 instance type: **m5.8xlarge**, 32GB of SSD storage, Amazon Linux AMI
    2. The cluster must be accessible from where Simple Replay is being run. This may entail modifying the security group inbound rules or running Simple Replay on the same VPC as the Redshift replica cluster. 
2. Install Simple Replay and libraries dependencies on the provided EC2 machine

In the newly created EC2 machine:

2.1 Install Python3

```
sudo yum install python3

sudo yum install python3-pip
```

2.2 Install ODBC dependencies

```
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ python36 python36-devel unixODBC unixODBC-devel
```

2.3 Clone Simple Replay scripts

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils.git
   ```

2.4 Install Python libraries

In Simple Replay root directory, you will find the file requirements.txt. Run the following command

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2.5 Install ODBC Driver for Linux

Follow the steps provided by the documentation and install ODBC Driver for Linux
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-odbc-connection.html

2.6 AWS CLI

Check if AWS CLI is configured in the machine. If it’s not configured, follow the steps in [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

2.7 Configure AWS CLI

```
aws configure
```
            * Provided IAM user should have Redshift and S3 permissions. If temporary IAM credentials are being used, ensure they do not expire before the replay ends.
            * The IAM user needs to have permission to read the Audit logs S3 bucket configured in Step 1. This is required for the Extraction step of Simple Replay.
            * The IAM user needs to have Redshift::GetClusterCredentials and redshift:DescribeLoggingStatus This is required for the Replay step of Simple Replay

### Step 3 - COPY and UNLOAD setup

The following steps are important to mimic any COPY and UNLOAD command 

1. S3 bucket for UNLOAD commands

Create a temporary S3 bucket where UNLOAD will spill data to S3.

1. IAM role for S3 COPY and UNLOAD commands

Create an IAM role with read access to S3 buckets where COPY will read from. Add write access to the temporary S3 bucket created in the previous step. Make sure the IAM role has a trust relationship with Redshift. This role will be attached to the replica cluster before running Simple Replay.

More information on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/copy-unload-iam-role.html

## Running Extraction

This script extracts query and connection info from User Activity Log (audit) and Connection Log (audit).

* Simple Replay will extract the logs from s3 automatically if the source cluster end point is provided as input in the YAML file. Customer can provide the s3 bucket or local directory in YAML file if as log location if they choose not to provide the source cluster endpoint
* Simple Replay will extract starttime and endtime for each query from the system table automatically if the source cluster end point is provided as input in the YAML file. Recordtime from audit logs will be used otherwise. 
* The source cluster should be accessible from wherever Simple Replay is being run. This may entail modifying the security group inbound rules to include “My IP”, or running Simple Replay on an EC2 instance in the same VPC.

| Source cluster information and log location (Either the source cluster endpoint and master user name OR the log location has to be provided)      |
| source_cluster_endpoint    |Optional    |If provided, Simple Replay will use [`describe-logging-status`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/redshift/describe-logging-status.html) to automatically retrieve the S3 audit log location. Additionally, Simple Replay will query [SVL_STATEMENTTEXT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVL_STATEMENTTEXT.html) to retrieve query start and end times. If this endpoint isn’t provided, or if the query cannot be found in SVL_STATEMENTTEXT, the record time present in the audit logs will be used for the query’s start and end times.    |"<redshift-cluster-name>.<identifier>.<region>.redshift.amazonaws.com:<port>\<databasename>"    |
| master_username    |Optional    |Required only if source_cluster_endpoint is provided.    |"awsuser"    |
| log_location    |Optional    |Required if source_cluster_endpoint is not provided, since audit log location is inferred from the cluster or customer wants to use a local location pointing at the downloaded S3 audit logs.    |""    |
| odbc_driver    |Optional    |If provided and installed extraction will use ODBC . Otherwise Redshift python driver (redshit_connector) is used. Used only if source_cluster_endpoint is provided.    |"Amazon Redshift (x86)"    |
| unload_system_table_queries    |Optional    |If provided, this SQL file will be run at the end of the Extraction to UNLOAD system tables to the location provided in source_cluster_system_table_unload_location.    |"unload_system_tables.sql"    |
| source_cluster_system_table_unload_location    |Optional    |Amazon S3 location to unload system tables for later analysis. Used only if source_cluster_endpoint is provided.    |“s3://mybucket/myunload”    |
| source_cluster_system_table_unload_iam_role    |Optional    |Required only if source_cluster_system_table_unload_location is provided. IAM role to perform system table unloads to Amazon S3 and should have required access to the S3 location. Used only if source_cluster_endpoint is provided.    |“arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:role/MyRedshiftUnloadRole”    |

### Command

Once the above configuration parameters are set in extraction.yaml, the workload from the source cluster can be extracted using the following command:

```
python3 extract.py extract.yaml
```

### Output

Simple Replay extract process produces the following outputs in the 

* <workload_location>/SQLs/
    * Contains the extracted SQL scripts named `<database>-<username>-<pid>-<xid>.sql`
* connections.json
    * Contains the extracted connections
* copy_replacements.csv
    * Contains the COPY locations found in the extracted workload. A replacement location may be specified to provide an alternate COPY location for replay. IAM role is mandatory to replay COPY workload.

## Running Replay

Takes an extracted workload and replays it against a target cluster.

### Preparation

* Restore the target cluster from the source cluster snapshot.
* The cluster must be accessible from wherever Simple Replay is being run.
    This may entail modifying the security group inbound rules to include “My IP”, or running Simple Replay on an EC2 instance in the same VPC.
* To execute COPY commands, the `execute_copy_statements` parameter must be set to `"true"`, and the “Replacement IAM role” column in the copy_replacements.csv file must have an IAM role for each row.
* Any UNLOAD/COPY command within stored procedures must be altered manually or removed to skip execution.

### Command

```
python3 replay.py replay.yaml
```

### Output

* Any errors from replay will be saved to workload_location provided in the `replay.yaml`
* Any output from UNLOADs will be saved to the replay_output provided in the `replay.yaml`
* Any system tables logs will be saved to the replay_output provided in the `replay.yaml`

## Limitations 

* Dependent SQL queries across connections are not guaranteed to run in the original order.
* Spectrum queries are not replayed if the target cluster doesn’t have access to external tables
* Queries with BIND variables are not replayed.
* COPY and UNLOAD command within stored procedures must be altered manually by the customers. 
* Replay using JDBC is not supported.
* If a connection’s session initiation or disconnection time are not found in the audit connection logs (e.g. outside of the specified `start_time` and `end_time`), the connection’s time is assumed to be the overall workload’s time.
* If a connection is not found in the audit connection log, but has queries associated with it in the user activity logs, the connection's `session_initiation_time` and `disconnection_time` are set to the overall workload's times. The connection will span the entire workload.
