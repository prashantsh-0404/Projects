**Please note that this is the README for Simpe Replay - Version 1.**

## Introduction

Customers are always trying to reproduce issues or workloads from clusters or to do what-if scenarios. A customer can easily clone a production cluster, but replicating the workload is more complicated. This set of tools was created to bridge that gap. 

* **ScriptRunner.sh**: Uses list of files [*sqls]* and executes all scripts at a pre-determined parallelism
* **SimpleReplay.sh**: Uses a ordered list of files (sqls) and replay them at the same cadence as originally.
* **ParseUserActivityLog.py**: Converts the User Activity Log (audit) into a series of sql scripts named `<DB>-<USERNAME>_<PID>.sql`
* **order_list.sh**: It will order the list of scripts by the time their original session started.
* **mitigate_duplicates.sh**: `sed` script to allow for duplicated CTAS on the same transaction.

## Usage  

### Preparation  

* Enable Amazon Redshift Audit Log. Specficially the User Activity Log https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/db-auditing.html 
* Collect the User Activit Logs (AUDIT) files from S3 for the desired time range. You can aggregate them into a single file or run one at a time in chronological order on the same folder.
* Run **ParseUserActivityLog.py** on file. A number of .sql files will be generated. <db>-<user>_<pid>.sql
* The optional parameter -c defines credentials to be added to the scripts if you want to replay COPY and UNLOAD statements. Note that the script will try to read/write the original bucket used on the workload
* The optional -r parameter tries to remove duplicate statements due to rewrites (it might remove user issued statements, so use with caution).
* The optional parameter -s will prefix any file that contain a write operation with rw-, so you can easily separate that workload. 
* Remove any files that you do not want to replay and make a new file listing all the files you want to replay. Normally I will move the files to a sub-folder
* If you want to replay on the same cadence as the original workload you should use **order_list.sh **script to order the **sqls** file.

### Replay at Arbitrary Concurrency  

`./ScriptRunner.sh <n> <sqls>`

* <n> is the number of sessions created and the scrpts referenced on sqls file will be distributed amonst the sessions.  
* <sqls> is the file that has the list of scripts to run

For long running replays, it is recomended to use 
```sh
nohup ./ScriptRunner.sh <n> <sqls> &
tail -f nohup.out
```

### Replay at the same cadence and concurrency as the original workload   
`./SimpleReplay.sh [-b <begin time> ] [-e <end time> | -r <seconds to run> ] [ <script list> ] [ <target concurrency> ] `
**<sqls>** optional, is the file with the list of scripts to be executed.**Important**: Scritps in this file need to be properly ordered. Use order_list.sh for that. Uses a file names sqls if not declared  **<tgt_conc>** optional, is the target concurrency in case you want to speed up issuing of statements. defaults to 0 meaning original cadence is respected

For long running replays, it is recomended to use
```sh
nohup ./SimpleReplay.sh [-b <begin time> ] [-e <end time> | -r <seconds to run> ] [ <script list> ] [ <target concurrency> ] &
tail -f nohup.out
```

## Known Limitations  

* When the original workload was executed with Redshift's JDBC driver the statements might show twice in the log.
* The replay script does not consider idle time within the sessions, only delay of starting each session.
* You should customize the **ParseUserActivityLog.py** file to keep/avoid any specific statement ( avoid writes or COPY, etc.).
